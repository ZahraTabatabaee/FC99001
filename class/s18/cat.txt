The cat is very cute an innocent animal. It is often kept at home as a pet. They have sharp claws, furry body and a bushy tail.
The cat is omnivore animal because it eats both meat and vegetables. But they love to eat meat and drink milk.
My pet cat Daisy darling is also fond of meat and milk. As cats have very powerful nocturnal vision or sight, they can see clearly in the dark.
Cats are usually very cute and friendly in nature.
My pet cat is with me when she was a kitten. When she was small, 
I used to feed her with my hands and used to keep a bowl full of milk for her to drink.
When she was a kitten I used to take good care of her, in winter I made her a warm bed to sleep. 
As she grew big, she became very smart and intelligent now she takes care of herself. She keep running around the home. 
When she get bored of our company, she goes out and play with cats of neighborhood.
I never forget to bring fresh meat and milk from market for her thrice a week. I also bring for her cat food from superstores.
I brush her teeth twice a week and wash her body with soap and brush her fur to keep her neat and tidy. 
She is often quiet and meows only she feel hungry. Her favorite food is boiled and fried fish and milk.
